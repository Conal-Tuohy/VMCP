<!-- 
	This file contains field definitions for the search and browse functions of the site.
	
	The definition controls three aspects of the fields:
	1	the field types in the Solr schema (how Solr should interpret the content)
	2	the field content (how the fields are populated from the TEI XML)
	3	the field display (how they are queried and displayed)
	
	The @name attribute defines the name of the field in Solr and in the HTTP query URIs. Use lower case, single token with no spaces.
	
	The @label attribute provides the field's label in the UI. Fields with no @label will not appear in the UI at all.
	
	The @type attribute controls how the content of the field is indexed by Solr: a type of "facet" causes the text to be treated as a single token;
	as does a type of "sort". Otherwise Solr treats the field as free text, and performs various kinds of tokenisation, stemming, etc, on it.
	
	The @xpath attribute defines the content of the field. 
	An XPath which returns a sequence of more than one item will produce a multi-valued field.
	The TEI namespace is the default. 
	The XPath version supported is 3.1.
