								<br />
								<p>William R. Newman received his Ph.D. in History of Science from <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> in 1986. He has been awarded fellowships, grants, and prizes from a wide variety of foundations, such as the <a href="http://www.gf.org/" target="_blank">John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://www.ias.edu/" target="_blank">Institute for Advanced Study</a>, the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/dibner/" target="_blank">Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a>.</p>
								<p>His main present research interests focus on early modern "chymistry" and late medieval "alchemy," especially as exemplified by Isaac Newton, Robert Boyle, Daniel Sennert, and the first famous American scientist, George Starkey. Much of his research has centered on the history of matter-theory, especially corpuscularism and atomism, and on the history of early chemical technology. He has taught courses on these subjects in the <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~hpscdept/" target="_blank">Department of History and Philosophy of Science</a>, as well as courses on early science and its relationship to natural philosophy more broadly.</p>

								<br />
								<p>Wally Hooper joined the Chymistry of Isaac Newton Project in 2007 as Programmer/Analyst and Project Manager. He is currently co-Principal Investigator with Newman on a three-year NSF project conducting a computational analysis of the language of alchemy in Newton's alchemical corpus. He is an Assistant Scientist/Scholar in the <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~hpscdept/" target="_blank">Department of History and Philosophy of Science</a> and Programmer/Analyst for the <a href="http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/" target="_blank">IU Digital Library Program</a>.</p>

								<p>He received a Ph.D. in the <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~hpscdept/" target="_blank">History and Philosophy of Science</a> from Indiana University in 1992. He held two Post-Doctoral Fellowships at the <a href="http://www.museogalileo.it/en/index.html" target="_blank">Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza</a> (now the Galileo Museum) in Florence, Italy, between 1992 and 1996. While there, he collaborated with physicists at the <a href="http://www.infn.it/indexen.php" target="_blank">Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare</a>, Sezione Firenze, to study the inks and papers in Galileo's manuscripts using proton-induced X-ray emissions in an attempt to determine the order of composition of undated collections of manuscript fragments on the problem of motion.</p>

								<p>Between 1996 and 2007, as Assistant Scientist/Scholar and Director of Software Development at the <a href="http://www.iub.edu/~aisri/index.shtml" target="_blank">American Indian Studies Research Institute</a> at IU, he worked closely with historians, anthropologists and linguists studying the languages and cultures of North American Plains Indians. He was co-PI on an NSF-funded project working on the compilation and publication of dictionaries of Northern Caddoan languages including Pawnee and Arikara and assisted lexicographical projects in Siouan languages and in Uzbek. He is familiar with current trends in lexicography, computational linguistics, and information retrieval, and writes code in most major programming languages and mathematical processing environments.</p>
